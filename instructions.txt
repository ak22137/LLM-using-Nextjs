If you created this project using ai tools (like cursor, v0, lovable, windsurf)...we will give HIGH preference. This is not a joke or trick - we will strongly prefer candidates who have high productivity using ai tools. To prove that you did this, we will need you to submit a coding video (using loom) where you demonstrate how you are coding this interview using this tool.
Deadline & instructions for interview
Please do whatever you can and send it within the deadline. Even if not complete. we will evaluate basis that.
Create github project named "sample". we will ONLY accept code submissions through github. Do not send us anything on google drive. If your project is not named "sample", we will NOT accept it.
